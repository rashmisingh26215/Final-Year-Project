Sentiment Analysis On Twitter Data

I've created a machine Learning python based web project for sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The app allows users to input specific hashtags or topics to retrieve relevant tweets and analyze their sentiment. The app offers a toggle feature for switching between "Expert mode" and "Normal mode" to access advanced functionalities and customize visualizations. Overall, it's a user-friendly tool for exploring sentiment trends on Twitter in an interactive manner.
